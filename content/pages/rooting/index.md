Title: Rooting the TV
save_as: rooting/index.html

## Should I Root Or Not?

Before rooting the TV, please think about what would you like to do with a rooted TV.

Use Kodi? That doesn't require root.

Stream PC games with Moonlight? That doesn't require root either.

For many usages, like installing some useful homebrews, root is **NOT** required.
Using developer mode is enough, and won't have any risk bricking the TV, or lose warranty.

### Benefits of Rooting

* Gain more control of the TV - block ads and auto-updates
* More modifications - Custom wallpaper, screensaver, [Ambient Lighting with Hyperion](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng), etc.
* Explore the whole Linux-based webOS - useful for researching

### Caveats of Rooting

* May get patched by LG - You'll lose homebrews and mods installed
* May void the warranty - LG seems to have ways to know if your TV's rooted
* May brick the TV - If you [mess with the system as we warned](https://rootmy.tv/warning)

## How to Use Homebrews Without Root?

Using [dev-manager-desktop](https://github.com/webosbrew/dev-manager-desktop) makes this pretty easy.

## Let Me Get Root Anyway!

As of November 2023, LG had released multiple patches against the vulnerbilities we found.
Depending on the firmware and model, there are multiple approaches to root the TV.

- [RootMy.TV](https://rootmy.tv/) - For webOS 3 and up, but very likely patched
- [crashd](https://gist.github.com/throwaway96/e811b0f7cc2a705a5a476a8dfa45e09f) - For webOS 4 and up, partially patched
- [GetMeIn](https://xdaforums.com/t/getmein-one-time-rooting-jailbreaking-tool-for-webos-lg-tvs.3887904/) - For webOS 3.4 and below on certain models
- [Hardware Modification](https://gist.github.com/throwaway96/827ff726981cc2cbc46a22a2ad7337a1) - Requires opening up the TV
